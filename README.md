PUNK API WEB APPLICATION

Overview:

Your task is to build a website using React based on the specifications outlined below. This will be based on the Punk API which contains all the data you will need for the task. You will have to use all of the skills you have gained over the course of the module to complete this challenge.
 
Requirements:

• Built entirely in React
• Use the Punk API (after using the data file first) (https://punkapi.com/)
• Unit test where possible
• Repository on GitHub

Plan:

Start - First part of the challenge - the sidenav, the main section containing the beers and beer cards for each piece of data.

Extension 1 - Once you've got the design and layout sorted to render the elements, it's time to add some search functionality. Make it so you can search the beers by their name, and the page content should update as you type each letter in the box.

Extension 2 - Finally attempt to make it so you can filter the content on three conditions:
• High Alcohol (ABV value greater than 6%)
• Classic Range (Was first brewed before 2010)
• High Acidity (pH lower than 4)
If you can’t achieve this after a good attempt, then feel free to move on to the final extension.

Extension 3 - Style the website however you see fit! Go wild!
